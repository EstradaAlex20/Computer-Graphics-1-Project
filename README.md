# Computer Graphics 1 Project

This is a game made using python and OpenGl. Most of this was a class project with the purpose of learning about OpenGl. We kind of arbitrarily chose to use python. This game is a 3rd person space shooter with some asteroids floating in 3D space. Each object in this game (the ship, the asteroids, the bullets, and the skybox) is a mesh in the form of a .obj file. This game also implements a diffuse, ambient, and reflective lighting.

## Running the Game

This game might be hard to run on your own computer, but if you would like to try all you need to do is pull the project down. Then you need to set an environment path for the libraries folder, specifically the PYSDL2 environment path. Then you can run the *main.py*.

## Built With

* [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/) - for using the graphics card to do the matrix math

## Authors

* **Alex Estrada** - *Initial work* - [EstradaAlex20](https://github.com/EstradaAlex20)
